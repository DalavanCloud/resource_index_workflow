387	Focal hypertrophic cardiomyopathy simulating a mass: MR tagging for correct diagnosis	"27-year-old man with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. , Transverse MR image shows localized hypertrophy in interventricular septum, simulating mass. Imaging was performed using ECG-gated spin-echo sequence (data matrix, 256 x 128; slice thickness, 5 mm; TR/TE, 952/11; two signals averaged; trigger delay, 231 msec after R wave). This image plane shows lobulated pseudomass bulging into right ventricle. Best practice is to acquire tagged images in same plane, which preserves worrisome morphology and shows contraction within morphology via tags. Altering image plane (as in ) may show septal thickening in characteristic configuration that dispels concern about mass, facilitating correct diagnosis. Ideally, two strategies complement one another."
388	Focal hypertrophic cardiomyopathy simulating a mass: MR tagging for correct diagnosis	"27-year-old man with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. , Long-axis tagged MR images obtained at five successive trigger delays show active displacement and deformation of tags in region of localized hypertrophy.

Radial sonogram of the inner region of the left breast (9 o'clock position) demonstrates a spiculated mass centrally (calipers) and several adjacent tubular masses. Core-needle biopsy (not shown) that was performed blindly in the surgeon's office yielded cancerization of the lobules. Preoperative US was performed (by drawing on the skin with permanent ink) to mark the area suspected of being involved by tumor. At US of the specimen, the spiculated mass was marked for the pathologist and proved to be infiltrating ductal carcinoma with adjacent multifocal DCIS. Clear margins were achieved. For purposes of the study, three lesions were recorded as being seen at both mammography and US, although all of the lesions were more conspicuous ultrasonographically."

101022	Use of radio-frequency ablation for the palliative treatment of sacral chordoma	"A 72-year-old male patient with recurrent sacral chordoma and regional invasion. All the images are obtained in the transverse plane T2-weighted Turbo spin-echo. Images A and B were obtained in December 2002; C and D depict the same regions as those of A and B (obtained August 2003). A, the single arrow points to invasion of the right gluteus muscle with extension into the subcutaneous tissues and the skin. The double arrow points to the involvement of the left gluteus muscle with encasement of the tract of the left sciatic nerve, which is not clearly defined and probably encased. Note the presence of invasion of the perineum bilaterally   shows regional invasion of the posterior pelvic wall with invasion of the sacrum, the piriformis muscle, and bilateral extension into the gluteus muscles. In addition, a metastatic deposit is seen anterior to the left sartorius muscle. Large metastatic iliac nodes are also noted. C, obtained in August 2003 (8 months later) at approximately the same level as A, shows the first site treated devoid of tumor tissue. The component at the skin remains intact. The third site treated   shows debulking of the tumor. Note that the left sciatic nerve tract and the fat planes surrounding it are better visualized, because of the retraction of the tumor secondary to ablation. Also note the increase in the extent of the involvement of the perineum with significant compression of the structures within it. The nontreated mass in the left gluteus muscle, laterally, increased in size. D, obtained in August 2003 at approximately the same level as B, shows the sacral masses, which were treated with significant loss of substance and volume. Note the reexpansion of the spaces at both sciatic notches with resultant decompression of both sciatic nerves tracts. Also note the remarkable increase in the involvement of the pelvic cavity with compression of the pelvic structures along the midline. There are also now more tumoral masses in the nontreated areas at the gluteus muscles bilaterally with atrophy of the left gluteus muscle."

139237	"Noninvasive vascular laboratory for evaluation of peripheral arterial occlusive disease: Part II--clinical applications: chronic, usually atherosclerotic, lower extremity ischemia"	"TcPO2 tension recording in a 58-year-old diabetic man with a large nonhealing ulcer of the right great toe.   Probe placement. One probe has been placed adjacent to the plantar aspect of the toe ulcer to estimate both the probability of healing of the ulcer with the aggressive conservative management or of a toe amputation if necessary. A second probe has been placed to record the tcPO2 at the dorsum of the foot to estimate the probability of healing a transmetatarsal amputation in case a toe amputation would not heal.   Display table of the results of same patient as in. Previously published validation results derived from our noninvasive vascular laboratory   and others suggest that an amputation of either the base of the great toe or the transmetatarsal level should heal because the resting tcPO2 exceeded 10 mm Hg, and oxygen supplementation by face mask for 5 minutes increased the tcPO2 by greater than 10 mm Hg at both tested locations. Furthermore, the ulcer has a relatively good chance to heal with aggressive conservative therapy. The resting right ankle blood pressure was 137 mm Hg, the right ABI was 0.95, the right second toe pressure was 46 mm Hg, and the toe brachial index was 0.32. Blood pressure recordings could not be performed on the great toe due to the ulcer. The depressed toe brachial index of 0.32 is indicative of severe PAOD, although the absolute second toe pressure of 46 mm Hg would suggest probable adequate vascular supply to heal the skin ulcer. The mildly abnormal ABI of 0.95 may indicate either that the preponderance of PAOD involves the small arteries of the foot, or that the ankle blood pressure is artifactually elevated because of medial calcification of the anterior and posterior tibial arteries, and that a significant component of PAOD may be present in the arteries above the ankle. Because arterial disease located above the ankle may be conducive to arterial revascularization, conventional angiography or MR angiography may be warranted. The ankle blood pressure of 137 mm Hg also supports the likelihood of healing a distal skin ulcer or amputation. "
